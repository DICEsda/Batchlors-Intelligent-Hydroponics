Why hydroponics is useful
Commonly cited benefits:

Much lower water use: recirculating systems can cut water use by roughly 80–90% vs field agriculture, because water is reused and goes directly to roots instead of being lost in soil.

Higher yields and faster growth: direct nutrient delivery and controlled environment can increase growth rates by about 30–50% and allow much higher plant density (up to ~16× in some setups).

Year‑round and location‑independent: controlled climate means no seasonality and the ability to grow in cities, deserts, or degraded soils.

Fewer pesticides and soil‑borne diseases: no soil means fewer soil pests and diseases, often leading to reduced pesticide use and cleaner produce.

Efficient land use and urban farming: vertical or compact systems enable high output on small footprints, helpful for urban food security.

Main challenges and drawbacks
Key issues that keep coming up in the literature and practice:

High initial investment: structures, pumps, sensors, lighting, and climate control are expensive, especially at commercial scale.

High energy use: artificial lighting and HVAC can make energy demand and carbon footprint significant, especially where electricity is fossil‑based.

Technical complexity: successful operation needs continuous monitoring of nutrient solution, pH, EC, temperature, and system health.

Disease and failure risks: if a recirculating system gets contaminated, waterborne pathogens can spread quickly; power or pump failures can also kill crops fast.

Limited crop range today: it works best for high‑value leafy greens, herbs, and some fruits; bulky staple crops are less economical in most current systems.

Potential benefits going forward
Where a lot of research and startups are focusing:

Climate resilience and food security: decoupling production from local climate, soil quality, and some water constraints could help supply food in cities, arid regions, and areas with degraded land.

Integration with renewable energy: pairing LED‑based hydroponic farms with solar or wind can reduce energy footprint and make systems more sustainable.
​

Smart/automated systems: sensors, IoT, and AI control are being used to optimize nutrients, light, and climate, aiming to improve yields and reduce labor and resource use.

Coupling with aquaponics and circular systems: integrating fish production (aquaponics) or nutrient recycling strategies can lower synthetic fertilizer use and environmental pollution.

If you tell me whether you want this more from a hobby‑grower angle or from a systems/engineering angle (since you study software engineering), I can point you to more technical papers, datasets, or even open‑source hydroponic control projects.
